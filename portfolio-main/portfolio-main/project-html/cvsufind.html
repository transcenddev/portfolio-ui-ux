          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            CVSUfind is a web-based platform that I have developed to simplify
            the process of finding, claiming, and connecting lost and found
            items in <b>Cavite State University</b>. The platform provides a
            seamless experience for users, ensuring that lost items are
            effortlessly reunited with their rightful owners.
          </p>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Losing personal items can be a frustrating and time-consuming
            experience. Traditional methods of reporting and searching for lost
            items often lack efficiency and can lead to a disconnect between the
            lost and the found. CVSUfind addresses this problem by creating a
            centralized platform that bridges the gap between the two,
            empowering users to easily navigate the recovery process.

        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The primary goal of CVSUfind is to facilitate a smooth and reliable
          lost and found experience through a meticulously designed UI/UX. By
          providing a user-friendly interface and streamlined tools, the
          platform aims to enable users to quickly and effectively report lost
          items, facilitate the connection between those who have lost and found
          items, and establish CVSUfind as a trusted and reliable solution for
          managing lost and found items.
