          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This project involves the redesign of a website dedicated to
            tracking, monitoring, and preserving mangrove crabs. The goal is to
            create a minimalistic yet elegant design that effectively
            communicates the importance of these activities while providing a
            visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The redesign
            focuses on a green color theme to reflect the natural habitat of
            mangrove crabs and uses sophisticated fonts to maintain an elegant
            look.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The existing website for had an outdated design and poor user
            experience. It was cluttered and hard to navigate, with inconsistent
            fonts and no clear way to highlight important information.
            Additionally, it was not optimized for mobile devices. The overall
            look did not reflect the desired modern and elegant aesthetic.

        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The aim is to design a user-friendly website for "Exploring the World
          of Mangrove Crabs" that feels modern and elegant. It should have a
          clean layout and intuitive navigation, making it easy for visitors to
          find information about tracking, monitoring, and preserving mangrove
          crabs. Using a cohesive green color theme and sophisticated fonts will
          improve readability and visual appeal. Consistency across all pages is
          key, and ensuring the website is responsive will provide a seamless
          experience on any device.

            The primary focus is the large, central text "Exploring the World of
            Mangrove Crabs", establishing the main topic. Supporting this is the
            smaller subtitle "Tracking Monitoring and Preserving", providing
            additional context. The "Learn more" call-to-action button
            encourages further exploration.

            This hierarchy clearly communicates the website's focus while
            effectively guiding the user's attention and interest.

            Finally, the immersive mangrove forest background image sets the
            scene and visual tone.
