          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This Observerwards sign-up and login interface serves as the entry
            point for users to access the platform and its functionalities. The
            clean, minimalist design follows a user-centric approach, guiding
            users through the account creation and authentication processes
            efficiently. The well-structured layout, key form fields, and clear
            calls-to-action work together to facilitate a streamlined onboarding
            and login experience that aligns with the Observerwards brand
            identity.
