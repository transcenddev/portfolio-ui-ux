          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Thirteean Milktea Shop is a local milk tea establishment in Naic,
            Cavite. The shop is looking to implement a user-friendly POS system
            to streamline their operations, improve customer experience, and
            better manage their business.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The current manual order-taking and cash management process at
            Thirteean Milktea Shop is inefficient, prone to errors, and creates
            delays in serving customers. The lack of a centralized system also
            makes it challenging to track sales, inventory, and customer data.

        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The primary goal is to design a POS system that will address the
          shop's pain points and provide a seamless experience for both the
          staff and customers. The system should enhance operational efficiency,
          improve order accuracy, and offer real-time insights to support
          business decision-making.
